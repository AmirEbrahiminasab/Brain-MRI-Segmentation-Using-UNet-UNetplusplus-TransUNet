# Brain-MRI-Segmentation-Using-UNet-UNetplusplus-TransUNet

This repository contains the implementation of a brain tumor segmentation task using MRI scans. The project focuses on applying deep learning models such as **U-Net**, **UNet++**, and **TransUNet** to identify cancerous regions in brain MRI images.

## 📄 Project Description

This project was completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Tehran. It involves:

- Preprocessing MRI images and corresponding masks from the **LGG Segmentation Dataset**
- Training multiple segmentation models
- Evaluating performance using Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, etc.
- Comparing our results with a benchmark research paper
